<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <p>Evidence title: IP - Stress Testing, Performance Testing & Load Testing</p> <p>Evidence description: <p>My application can handle around 500 RPS. after that it already starts to fail requests. Even with the Reverse Proxy configured which has built in Server Load Balancing (2 servers). This does give an idea of where my performance stands and how much concurrent users it can handle, and when it breaks. important to mention that my project does not have additional setup for load balancing, but RP does bring DoS protection.</p></p> <p>Linked goal(s):</p> <ul> <li>Learning Outcome 3</li><li>Learning Outcome 6</li> </ul> <p>Linked collection(s):</p> <ul> <li>Learning Outcomes Evidences</li> </ul> </body> </html>
