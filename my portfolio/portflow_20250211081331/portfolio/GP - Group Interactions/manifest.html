<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <p>Evidence title: GP - Group Interactions</p> <p>Evidence description: <p>Everday at 09:30 we do a stand-up. In this stand-up everyone gets tasks assigned that he works on the entire day. If a task is done you can assign yourself a new task. This gives the rest of the group the idea what others are working on. At the end of the day we do a stand-down where everyone showscases/explains what he has done. This activity tells the group if someone is actively working on the group project or not, depending on how much he has to show.</p></p> <p>Linked goal(s):</p> <ul> <li>Learning Outcome 2</li> </ul> <p>Linked collection(s):</p> <ul> <li>Learning Outcomes Evidences</li> </ul> </body> </html>
