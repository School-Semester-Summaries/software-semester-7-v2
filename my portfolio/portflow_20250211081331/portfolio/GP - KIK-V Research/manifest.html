<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <p>Evidence title: GP - KIK-V Research</p> <p>Evidence description: <p>KIK-V is one of the partners that is related to our stakeholders so I started researching what it exactly is. After some research we realised that this is out of our scope so we left it as it is. We decided to research KIK-V because we didn't really know what else to do, but since we have clear tasks now there's no use in researching KIK-V.</p></p> <p>Linked goal(s):</p> <ul> <li>Learning Outcome 1</li> </ul> <p>Linked collection(s):</p> <ul> <li>Learning Outcomes Evidences</li> </ul> </body> </html>
