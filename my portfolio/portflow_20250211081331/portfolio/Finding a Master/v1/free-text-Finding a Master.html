<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <p>To look for an AI master, I started by mailing Nico Kuijpers and talking to a former master student. They told me more about their knowledge/experiences. It looks like most of the masters are heavily focussed on theory without any focus on practise which i dislike. I have found many AI masters which are 100% theory with exams and tests. But I am trying to find a master which looks more like the study I am currently following, with projects and no exams. </p> </body> </html>
