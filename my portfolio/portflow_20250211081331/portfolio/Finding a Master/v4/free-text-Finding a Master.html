<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.88)">To look for an AI master, I started by mailing Nico Kuijpers and talking to Mehmet B., a former master student. They told me more about their knowledge/experiences. It looks like most of the University Masters are heavily focussed on theory without any focus on practise which i dislike. I have found many AI masters which are 100% theory with exams and tests. But I am trying to find a master which looks more like the study I am currently following, with projects and no exams.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.88)">This brought me to HBO masters. I am pretty sure that if I will follow any sort of master that it will be an HBO AI Master, but I am not yet convinced if it will be worth 2 years of my time.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.88)"><strong>UPDATE</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.88)">If i will do a master I will do HBO level master in AI but i am not 100% sure yet if its worth it. For now I will wait it out and see how my graduation internship goes and based on that I will decided whether I will do a master or not. </span></p> </body> </html>
